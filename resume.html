        <h2>Summary</h2>

        <p>
            I'm a <em>software engineer</em> with a passion for technology and all things computation. I've been at this for as long as I can remember and I'm not giving this up, any time soon. For a long time all I wanted was to be part of a game development company (and to some degree I still do). But after landing an internship at EA <a href="http://dice.se/" target="_blank" title="DICE">DICE</a> I knew I had a a long way to go before I could be a part of something like that again. And since then, each challange has been an opportunity to grow both as an programmer and human.

        <h2>Experience</h2>

        <h3 class="job-title">Lead Software Engineer</h3>
        <h3 class="company-name">Snow Software</h3>
        <h3 class="period">June 2013 &ndash; current</h3>

        <p>
            Taking on additional responsibilities and continue to drive development efforts across the company.
        </p>

        <h3 class="job-title">Software Engineer</h3>
        <h3 class="company-name">Snow Software</h3>
        <h3 class="period">May 2011 &ndash; May 2013</h3>

        <p>
            I've written everything from a Windows kernel-mode software driver to a distributed software inventory tool and then some. I work on new and old products and trying to figure out how to get from where we are to where we need to be.
        </p>

        <p>
            These are just some projects I've worked on:
        </p>

        <ul>
            <li>A public-key infrastructure (PKI) for digital rights managment (DRM)</li>
            <li>A resilient XML parser</li>
            <li>A package format in C#, C++ and Java</li>
            <li>A data-driven extensible HTML5 data grid component</li>
            <li>A NDIS filter driver for network packet capture</li>
        </ul>

        <h3 class="job-title">Software Engineer, Consultant</h3>
        <h3 class="company-name">Mira Network</h3>
        <h3 class="period">April 2009 &ndash; April 2011</h3>

        <p>
            I learned quickly that I wanted to be part of a company that designed products. However, the consulting business  was not my cup of tea.
        </p>

        <p>
            While at Mira Network I worked on:
        </p>

        <ul>
            <li>A dynamic SQL builder that allowed complex SQL queries to be composed at run-time (with static type checking)</li>
            <li>A auto complete search box that could page through large data sets quickly</li>
            <li>A customizable search engine built on-top SQL Server that allowed users to drill down and filter search results</li>
        </ul>

        <h3 class="job-title">Internship</h3>
        <h3 class="company-name">Electronic Arts (EA), DICE</h3>
        <h3 class="period">September 2008 &ndash; January 2009</h3>

        <p>
            I did my master's thesis on network bandwith optimization. While at DICE I met with a lot of really intresting and skilled people. I still benchmark my own skill with what I glanced from these people during my time there.
        </p>

        <p>
            I identified network bottlenecks by instrumenting and profiling the Frostbite engine. Presented a solution on how to improve bandwidth utilization by relying on a history of previously transmitted data, while being efficient about memory usage.
