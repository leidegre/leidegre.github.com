I work as a Lead Software Engineer at Snow Software, we build tools and 
technology for [SAM][1] (Software Asset Management).

The company really is a great place to work. Most of us enjoy a lot of creative freedom
as long as we make responsible decisions. 
Building the company with this creative mindset is hard but with the right people
we can do just that, and that's why you should consider working with us.

 * I believe people who are really passionate about thier work have more to offer.
 * I believe in skillful people with both breadth and depth.
 * I believe in people whom are self-improving (motived to realize one's full potential).
 * I believe in those whom enjoy working with others.

We are always looking for people with expertise in C++, C#, HTML/CSS/JavaScript, REST, SQL Server/T-SQL and
everything there in between. If you (**individuals only/no organizations**) know a lot about at least two of these topics, feel free to contact me anytime at

We are located in Solna, Stockholm, Sweden.

***I have to insist that if you work for a requirement/HR organization that you do not contact me at all. This is an opportunity for people with the right skillset and these people know, well on thier own, if this is a job for them or not.***
