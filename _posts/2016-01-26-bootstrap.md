Not saying it's a one stop shop for everyone but if you take a look what's been added to version 4, I think a lot of people will be pleased.

I've written a lot of CSS. The hardest part is making something that's simple yet consistent amoungst browsers. By not doing any of this yourself and simply sticking to what works out of the box with bootstrap you're saving yourself from a lot of rainy days. And I cannot stress this enough. Every time you think (or told to) do something if there isn't a straightforward way to do it. **Don't.** 

Always figure out a redicously simple way to do it first the when you're done (and only when you're done) may you consider further changes. I call this a win. You've successfully prevented yourself from making something which could have been really complicated.

> I'm not really going to be blogging web development as much as I'm using this blog post as an excuse to test Bootstrap.

The idea here was to bring in less (as in less stuff). By switching to Bootstrap (I'm using version 3 right now) I can clean up my HTML (somewhat) and delete my CSS. I still use some JavaScript hackery to get the Twitter feed in the way I like it but that might go away in the future.

 Without further ado, I present to you an incremental update to blog where I replaced my own CSS with something like Bootstrap. And it has been great! I also added an edit button (for myself of course) but anyone can really use it and if you feel as if something is really poorly worded or should be changed I wouldn't mind merging a pull request if the changes are in the style of a note so that it's clear that it's an addendum (and maybe that I didn't write it). Feedback is welcome.
